### Prerequisites

You will need **Git** installed on your system to clone the repository.

### Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project environment:

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
    ```bash
    git clone <YOUR_GIT_CLONE_LINK_HERE>
    cd <PROJECT_DIRECTORY_NAME>
    ```
    *Replace `<YOUR_GIT_CLONE_LINK_HERE>` with the actual link.*

2.  **Install `uv`**
    This project uses `uv` for dependency management and running the application. Follow the official instructions to install it:
    * [uv Installation Guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#standalone-installer)
    * *Alternatively, you can often install it via pip or a standalone script, depending on your OS.*

3.  **Install Dependencies**
    With `uv` installed, synchronize the project's required libraries (dependencies) by running:
    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```
    This command will create a virtual environment and install all packages listed in the project's dependency files (e.g., `requirements.txt`).

4.  **Run the Application**
    Execute the main application file (`main.py`) using `uv run`:
    ```bash
    uv run main.py
    ```
    The application should now be running!
